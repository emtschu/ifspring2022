                He came from somewhere back in her long ago
                <br>The sentimental fool don't see</br>
                Tryin' hard to recreate
                <br>What had yet to be created once in her life</br>
                She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
                <br>Never coming near what he wanted to say</br>
                Only to realize it never really was

                <br>Anybody else would surely know</br>
                He's watching her go
