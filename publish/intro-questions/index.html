        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Emma Schumacher, Communication Design, Junior</p>

        <p>2. My background is primarily in graphic design, but I also have a minor in marketing. I started out as a fine artist, drawing and painting throughout high school, but have gradually shifted over to digital mediums. I am taking this course not only because it is a requirement for my major, but also because I am interested in entering the UX/UI field.</p> 

        <p>3. This will be my first time working with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>

        <p>4. I am hoping to gain enough knowledge in coding to be able to improve on my personal portfolio website.</p>

        <p>5. I expect this process to focus more on action and reaction than the traditional print publications. For instance, how can certain qualities change when the user moves their mouse? This in not usually a focus for a poster, which is simply for viewing.</p>

        <p>6. The website for <a href="https://thisislandscape.com/">Landscape Studio</a> shows fantastic design. It has a great home screen that gives the viewer a brief glimpse at their body of work, and upon scrolling, suggests certain projects that may be of interest. The drop-down navigation bar is simple and to the point. The screens when transitioning between tabs is a great way to please the viewer while they wait for the tab to load.</p>

        <p>7. The website for <a href="https://draw-down.com/">Draw Down Books</a> uses simple communication extremely well. Not only does it give categories of books at the top of the page, it also organizes titles by recent releases, specific topics, and offers low-price options. The viewer sees a picture of the product, the title of the product, and its price all in one view.</p>

        <p>8. The website <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts In Use</a> is one that works well in my experience. The website provides multiple ways to search by topic, format, or typeface, and even includes an advanced search feature. For users wanting to find specific information or have a general idea of what they are looking for, Fonts In Use provides an easy way to find this information.</p>
