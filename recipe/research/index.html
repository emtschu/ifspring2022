                            Vanilla Scones are light, fluffy and melt in your mouth. Pure vanilla bean paste takes these vanilla scones to the next level. If you’re a scone lover like me, you have to make these! They are delicious!

                        <h1>Instructions</h1>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees and line a baking mat with parchment paper or a non-stick baking mat; set aside.</li>
                            <li>In a stand-alone mixer fitted with a paddle attachment mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and granulated sugar. Add cold cubed butter and mix on low-speed until course crumbs forms - careful not to over-mix.
                            </li>
                            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and vanilla then add it to the mixer and mix until dough comes together. It will be crumbly.</li>
                            <li>Flour a clean service and kneed dough just a bit until it comes together. Form it into a circle about 1 inch in thickness. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut scones into 8 wedges. Place on baking sheet and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake for 10-14 minutes or until edges are slightly golden. Remove from oven and place on a cooling rack to cool.</li>
                            <li>While scones are cooling, add all the glaze ingredients into a bowl and whisk - glaze will be slightly thick but should drizzle off a spoon. Use a spoon to spread glaze over cooled scones. Let stand until glaze is set.</li>
                        </ol>

                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Half-Baked Harvest is a great balance of aesthetics and practicality. The segments are well organized and informs the reader of each element in the recipe, using decorative fonts to distinguish headers. The website explains the recipe in written detail at the top of the page, then provides a nice brief of the recipe that can be shared or printed at the bottom of the page.

                                Food Network is a great simple, concise example of a recipe page. It gets right to the recipe without having to scroll through a whole story from the chef. It clearly displays ingredients on the left, instructions on the right and can be viewed all at once so you don't have to worry about scrolling mid-cooking.

                                Tasty primarily works in video content, but provides a written and viewing experience to help guide users through this recipe. The recipe and ingredients are listed on the left of the page, with an accompanying video on the right. The video has a direct link and preview feature which is clear and concise.

                            </li>
                            <p>
                                Haus has a great high-contrast design in terms of colors, typeface, and page breaks. The website provides ample visuals to accompany a rich description of the ingredients that make up their products, and have an easy access clicking feature to view nutritional information. They even show best ways to serve their product, so the user leaves well informed.

                                <p>
                                    Paloroma is a kids skincare brand with fantastic website design. They keep it simple and elegant with muted colors and lots of negative space, with decorative navigation bars in the side margins and a scrolling bar with light orange line dividers. The color scheme is very consistent and leaves room for play in the scrolling experience. I would take inspiration primarily from the appearance of this site because it is absolutely gorgeous in appearance.

                                <p>
                                    Rishi Tea has a great way of organizing information about their products on a singular page. Instructions are represented simply through icons, and they hit every detail including a full description and additional detail about the taste of the product. All can be viewed without having to scroll, which consolidates things very neatly. Overall, very user-friendly and has some smart tactics for delivering information simply and beautifully.
